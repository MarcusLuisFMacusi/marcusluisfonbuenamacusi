					<p>Following a tense start to the match Fan Zhendong appeared more composed in games two and three, pulling out a commanding 3-0 lead. Understandably the home fans were hoping to see a European winner crowned and Timo Boll responded in game four to reduce the deficit but ultimately the gap proved too big to overcome as Fan Zhendong made certain of the win at the first match point opportunity (11-9, 11-5, 11-6, 9-11, 11-8).</p>

					<p>The stage was set: Fan Zhendong vs Timo Boll, China vs Germany, former champion vs former champion but who would emerge victorious under the lights at the Disney Event Arena?</p>
					<p>Victorious against the German legend in all three of their previous encounters but Fan Zhendong was pushed hard in the early stages of the final, edging to an opening game win by just a two-point margin.</p>
					<p>Kicking-off the programme was an intriguing fixture between Germanyâ€™s Timo Boll and Dimitrij Ovtcharov, good friends off the table but at Disneyland Paris they would become rivals.</p>
					<p>Seeded one position above his opponent and gaining the upper hand earlier in the year when the two met at the 2018 Europe Top 16 Cup, you could have been forgiven for labelling Timo Boll as the slight favourite for the win but Dimitrij Ovtcharov was not to be underestimated, he was after all the defending champion.</p>
